# Wiki Dumps from the Internet Archive

We need to download 4.4 TB from the Internet Archive.

If we had a Gigabit connection it would take 9 hours to download.

Based on the Internet, people say the IA generally has a bandwidth of 10 Mbps to 1 Mbps, and the longer you download the less bandwidth they give to you.

| Bandwith | Hosts | Time to DL |
|----------|------:|-----------:|
| 1 Gb/s   | 1     | 9h 40m     |
|          | 4     | 2.3h       |
|          | 10    | 0.9h       |
| 10 Mb/s  | 1     | 40d 17h    |
|          | 4     | 10d +      |
|          | 10    | 4d +       |
| 1 Mb/s   | 1     | 407d 9h    |
|          | 4     | 101d +     |
|          | 10    | 40d+       |
|          | 100   | 4d+        |
|          | 500   | 0.8d       |

We really need hardware based parallelism
